## Problem
The starter Next.js app provided by create-next-app has a few missing pieces.

## What This Solution Adds
- SSR rendering of styled component styles out of the box
- Dynamically imports netlify-cms so you can re-use your React/page components as preview templates
- Provides common set of default packages:
    
    - app:
        - formik
        - react-icons
        - react-markdown
        - styled-components
        - styled-media-query
        - styled-normalize
    - dev: 
        - typescript
        - eslint
        - prettier
        - jest
        - react-testing-library
        - commitlint
        - husky
    

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and run the development server:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kwyoung11/next-netlify-cms-starter
cd next-netlify-cms-starter
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
