title: About Me
---
Starting in 2009 I began learning how to build websites with HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and MySQL. While studying for my first degree in Kinesiology I continued my interest in programming by building activeterps.com, a social fitness app for college students, using Ruby on Rails. After graduating in 2012, I had taken three online CS MOOC's ([](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/)[[1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/)], [](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS106A)[[2](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS106A)] and [[3](https://courses.edx.org/courses/BerkeleyX/CS-CS169.1x/3T2014/course/)][](https://courses.edx.org/courses/BerkeleyX/CS-CS169.1x/3T2014/course/)) before I decided to kick my learning into high gear. I went back to UMD to get a CS degree, where I attended hackathons, worked for the Maryland Institute of Advanced Computer Studies as a full-stack web dev, and built some really cool passion projects ([](https://kyoung.codes/portfolio/rainsense)[[1](https://kyoung.codes/portfolio/waterlog)], [[2](https://kyoung.codes/portfolio/rainsense)]).

After I graduated, I worked at [Perfect Sense](https://www.perfectsensedigital.com/) building high-traffic features and tracking and squashing down bugs for Fortune 500 companies. Soon after, I founded [Strengthify](https://strengthify.com), another fitness site to track and log workouts. I now do freelance consulting work, mostly front-end + Javascript, and contribute to OSS projects on GitHub ([Netlify CMS](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms), [next-netlify-cms-starter](https://github.com/kwyoung11/next-netlify-cms-starter)). See more projects I've done [here](https://kyoung.codes/portfolio). See my full resume on [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/kevwy).

In my spare time, I like to learn about new technologies, go cycling, hike outdoors or head to the gym.

I currently reside in Green Bay, WI.
