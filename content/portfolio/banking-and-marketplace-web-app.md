I developed the front-end for a banking and marketplace web app according to given wireframes and worked with backend developers to integrate with a .NET API.

Technologies used throughout the engagement were:

React, Redux, Redux Saga, Material UI, Styled Components, CSS-in-JS, Typescript, Parcel, Canvas.js.

Notable features included:

* Landing and information pages with images, tables, and graphs using canvas.js.
* Highly reusable data table component with server-side sorting, filtering and virtual scrolling using the OData protocol.
* Multiple authentication states with varying permissions.
* Fully responsive design.
* Complex administrative behavioral flows with side-by-side forms and data tables.
* User flows such as profile pages, document upload and app-specific behavior that included forms, redirection and authorization.
