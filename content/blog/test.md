The arepa is a very popular and traditional food from Colombia and Venezuela that has been cooked and eaten in those regions since pre-columbian times. Colombians and Venezuelans always hotly debate who first invented them, but it happened *somewhere* in the area of those two countries when corn began to be cultivated for agricultural use. 

The arepa is made with ground corn flour or pre-cooked corn flour, shaped into a ball and flattened to form a small circle. In Colombia the arepa plays a large and vital role in peoples' every day diet. It is eaten daily, usually plain perhaps with butter and salt for breakfast, or stuffed with various ingredients for lunch or dinner. It plays a large part in Colombian culture and identity and has passed from generation to generation.

What's interesting is that there are many different styles of arepa depending on the department in Colombia you may find yourself in. *Arepas de Chocolo,* typical of the Antioquia region where Medellín is located, are made from a mixture of ground fresh corn and **masarepa**, a special pre-cooked corn meal. In Boyacá you can find two types of arepas common to that region, *Arepas de Trigo* which are made from whole wheat flour and can be fried or cooked on the grill, and *Arepas Boyacenses* which is made from a mix of masarepa, wheat flour, butter and milk.

Not too long ago, before the industrialization process made food preparation more efficient, the arepa was a recipe some would call laborious and extensive. It involved cooking the corn kernels with wood ash ("ceniza") or calcium hydroxide ("cal"), washing the kernels and then peeling the outer layer off. After that, the kernels would be ground and mixed with water to obtain the flour-like consistency. 

Luckily, the process of making arepas was made much easier when they started selling pre-cooked corn meal or masarepa in supermarkets, ready to mix. A popular brand is called Harina Pan and can be found in the Hispanic foods aisle or in Latin or International grocers. The two most common forms of this flour are the one packaged in yellow that contains pre-cooked white corn flour, or the one packaged in orange that contains pre-cooked yellow corn flour. In reality there isn't much difference in taste between the two, and the method of preparation is the same, so either one works for this recipe.

P.A.N. is a spanish acronym that stands for \\"Producto Alimenticio Nacional\\" or \\"National Food Product\\" in english, signifying this flour was meant for mass consumption.")

Arepas can be served stuffed with a ton of different ingredients. This version has avocado, chicken, and black beans. Not only are they SUPER delicious and on top of that quite easy to make, but they are also a healthy and filling meal!
